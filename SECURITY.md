# Security Guide for Drumlog

## üîí Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Path Traversal Protection**
- **Issue**: Username was directly used in file paths without sanitization
- **Fix**: Added `sanitize_filename()` function to remove dangerous characters
- **Impact**: Prevents attackers from accessing files outside the intended directory

### 2. **Password Security**
- **Issue**: Passwords were stored in plain text
- **Fix**: Implemented SHA-256 password hashing
- **Impact**: Even if `users.py` is compromised, passwords remain secure

### 3. **File Upload Security**
- **Issue**: No file size limits or content validation
- **Fix**: Added file size limits (10MB) and row count limits (10,000 rows)
- **Impact**: Prevents DoS attacks and resource exhaustion

### 4. **Session Security**
- **Issue**: Client-side session state could be manipulated
- **Fix**: Added session tokens and validation
- **Impact**: Better session integrity and logout functionality

### 5. **Input Sanitization**
- **Issue**: User input could contain malicious content
- **Fix**: Added length limits and character sanitization
- **Impact**: Prevents injection attacks and data corruption

### 6. **Error Information Disclosure**
- **Issue**: Detailed error messages exposed system information
- **Fix**: Generic error messages for users, detailed logging for debugging
- **Impact**: Prevents information leakage to attackers

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Streamlit Cloud Deployment:

1. **Use Streamlit Secrets** instead of `users.py`:
   ```toml
   # .streamlit/secrets.toml
   [users]
   username1 = "hashed_password1"
   username2 = "hashed_password2"
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables

3. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure your Streamlit app uses HTTPS

4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

### For Local Development:

1. **Secure `users.py`**: Never commit this file to version control
2. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords and hash them properly
3. **File Permissions**: Ensure data files have appropriate permissions

## üîß How to Add Users

### Method 1: Using users.py (Local)
```python
import hashlib

# Hash your password
password = "your_secure_password"
hashed = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()
print(f"Hashed password: {hashed}")

# Add to users.py
USERS = {
    "your_username": "hashed_password_here"
}
```

### Method 2: Using Streamlit Secrets (Cloud)
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[users]
your_username = "hashed_password_here"
```

## üö® Security Checklist

- [ ] Passwords are hashed (not plain text)
- [ ] File uploads are validated and size-limited
- [ ] User input is sanitized
- [ ] Error messages don't expose system information
- [ ] Session tokens are used
- [ ] Path traversal is prevented
- [ ] Data files are properly secured

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Never commit `users.py`** to version control
2. **Use strong, unique passwords** for each user
3. **Regularly audit** user access and remove unused accounts
4. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Backup data** regularly but securely

## üîç Monitoring

The app now logs security-relevant events:
- Failed login attempts
- File upload errors
- Data validation errors
- Session issues

Check your Streamlit logs for any suspicious activity.
